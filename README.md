# webscrapping
This repository is dedicated to purely for webscrabing, image scraping. 
Deep learning and CNN requires a good number of pictures from a different angle.  
Manually taking pictures is time-consuming whereas the internet has a huge amount of image we can download by an automated python program.  
I hope this code may help you with your project. 

Note:
this is a single function that downloads random pictures from the engine, especially the image are free to download, 
for more pictures use the different keyword for the same objects.
